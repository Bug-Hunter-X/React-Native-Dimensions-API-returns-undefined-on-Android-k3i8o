This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that the `Dimensions` API might return `undefined` initially, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes if your code tries to access its properties before the values are available. This is often asynchronous, and your component might mount before the dimensions are ready.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
// ...use width and height here...
```
